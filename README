A simple iPad app that demonstrates using Haskell in an iPad app.

The Haskell app is a Lisp interpretter.

The code is licensed under an MIT license.

The Lisp (Scheme) interpretter is based very, very closely on 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours

In order to run the code, you'll need ghc-iphone http://projects.haskell.org/ghc-iphone/

And, yes, the UI is ugly... I do historically ugly UIs in AppKit:

Note the first bullet point is a redesigned UI.

Also, this code is totally, 100% unsupported.
